The MAX30100 is a Pulse oximetry heart-rate monitor sensor solution from Maxim Integrated. It combines two LEDs, a photodetector, optimized optics, and a low-noise analog signal processor to detect pulse oximetry and heart-rate signals. 

There are a few break-out boards available that make it easy to use this solution; I am using this one for my example implementation: https://makerusa.net/product/max30102-pulse-oximeter-heart-rate-sensor/

In this project, I have tried to build a sample application using a 0.91" OLED display driven by the U8g2 lib. 

Here's a video demonstrating the project https://youtu.be/63iZt5M-cik
